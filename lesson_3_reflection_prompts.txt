When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I often work on different computers, it is necessary for me to access the same project I'm work on.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I think pull changes manually is more reflexible.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    When I'd like to have edit or use the files in other repository on Github, I can fork it so that I will have the same repository on my Github.
    However, clone can apply to the situation copy the repository between the remote and local side.
    Branches exist in single repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    When collaborate with other partners, we can know the latest version.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    I think I will create a Dropbox shared folder which anyone collaborate can upload the updated version onto it once project has been modified.
    In my opinion, git is not that easy to learn. However, once you're familiar with it, it must be a great tool to make the version control and collboration much more convenient and efficient.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When I'd like to modify the file which collaborate with others, I'll create a new branch name it with a specific name. Finally, it can be merge (pull request) on Github. After merged, branch can be deleted.
